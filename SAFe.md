[**S**caled **A**gile **F**ramework for **e**nterprise](https://scaledagileframework.com/) (SAFe) is a framework for operating lots of teams on a release train in an agile, organised and planned manner.

A lot of concepts are covered in the tooling of SAFe, including perscription of models and frameworks to employ. It uses many of the concepts from other frameworks, such as [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]], [[DevOps]] and project management frameworks like [[PRINCE2]] and combines them to form something that is intended to work at an enterprise level. As such, it is likely the case that in most organisations this is inappropriate for execution, and that there are instead organisational problems that are blocking the adoption of [[Agile]].
