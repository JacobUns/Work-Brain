# Welcome
This knowledge repository started as a second brain for all of the work I have done since the beginning of 2023.

Over the years, I found that I learned new techniques, models and frameworks or developed tools for myself that after moving to new companies I lost to time. As someone with a learning disability, I look for coping mechanisms and after being introduced to the concept of creating a second brain I've slowly built out this content based on my experience, resources I've been directed to or wish to spend more time learning. There are either headings to be filled that provide me a reminder of something I once knew or that give a level of detail to what it is, how it was used, and what it looked like in use.
