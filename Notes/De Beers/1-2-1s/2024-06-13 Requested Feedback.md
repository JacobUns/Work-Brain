The below information was provided via email to my new line manager following an organisational restructure that saw my existing manager being made redundant. The brief was to provide information on my background, the projects I was involved in, my commitments to the business for the year, things that worked in the old structure, things that didn't work in the old structure, and what suggestions I had for the future were.

# Product Teams
Both Shilpi and I work with two Product teams/groups each. Those Product teams have key deliverables known as Epics or Features that they work towards on their products in a hierarchical structure so it’s not inherently easy to call out specific projects that are in flight.

The teams I am currently working with are:
## Autoflow
- Currently developing:
	- {Redacted Project Name} assortment changes
	- Machine Track replacement options
	- {Redacted Product Name} Software Technical Debt
## ICS
- Currently developing:
	- AMOM Analytics engine capabilities
	- IoT Agent service & accompanying production rollout
	- Integration & Support of 3DT into the Fleet Management ecosystem

## Leadership
I have also been working on departmental initiatives, including:
- TeamMood rollout – Emotional Health Checkin service established within the Tech Inc Department
- Transparent and standardized Delivery Metrics w/ Power BI
- Transparent and standardized Team Health Metrics w/ Power BI
- Tech Inc departmental testing standards

Autoflow is a recent pick-up for me following the closure of the MST team & ACAS Product development.

# 2024 Commitments

## Open
- Deliver Machine Driven KPIs for Autoflow machine data to enable AMOM delivery in 24Q4 – On Track
- Enable transparency of delivery metrics for continuous improvement – On Track
- Deliver Autoflow Operator integrated KPIs for AMOM – On Track
- Operationally ready ACAS system – <p style="font-color:red"> No longer applicable </p>
## Completed
- Mechanism to elevate and make transparent the mental health state of the department.

# Things that have worked

- Scrum Methodology has worked well for MST, Autoflow & ICS.
- Lean development practices within MST (Assumption & Hypothesis testing) prove agile methodologies work in all fields and domains.
- Relative estimation in use in Autoflow & ICS and story cycle-time/velocity in MST leading to more accurate delivery.
- Cross-functional departmental leadership, covering Engineering, Product and Delivery representation, enables more successful change.
- The desire to see continual improvement driven by the function lead.
- The autonomy and empowerment provided to the department leadership team.
- Collaborative approach to departmental change and continuous improvement
- Transparency of work in progress, both on a team and leadership level.
- Roadmapping and regularly reviewing the change as a cross-functional leadership team.
- Empowered leadership team, encouraged to work together to affect change and enable the desired culture.
- Chris’s approach to product management has helped the teams he’s worked with immensely in developing the right value, and all of the practices are grounded in Agile & Lean concepts

# Things that have not worked

- Product Management presence in ICS and Autoflow has been almost non-existent recently due to Rob’s being pushed back into an Engineer role for SADE.
- No transparency of budget usage.
- Severely under-resourced for the company’s ambitions and quantity of products in development.
- Arbitrary deadlines placed on teams due to commercial promises, leaving the team behind before they even start.
- Continual pull-on resources in other teams.
	- Tom being pulled from MST to AMS development, completely blocking automation development.
	- Julian being pulled from MST to AMS development with little structure behind what he would work on, completely blocking development of multiple streams on ACAS.
		- The ripple effects of this would continue to be seen for 2-3 months after his return to the team.
	- Regularly looking to bring people into teams to get them properly resourced for the development.
		- This is a result of the third point re. under-resourcing
- Non-existent Testing standards and minimal testing capacity.
	- Only two QAs currently in the department across 4-5 teams, leading to no formal testing on multiple initiatives.
- Time-based estimates still in use in AMS/Polished development.
	- Time-based estimation is the worst way for us to estimate work due to the levels of inaccuracy observable.
- Cultural change has been slow.
	- Use of terminology such as [“Management” rather than “Leadership”](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/leadership-vs-management), for instance, reinforces negative connotations due to stereotyping of the term.
	- Use of terminology such as “Resource” when referring to people in teams dehumanized them
- All teams work in significantly different ways, making change difficult.
- Follow-through on discussed change
- Lack of ability to address Technical Debt due to continual firefighting, tight deadlines or lack of focus. This may sound like a Tech Department problem, but there needs to be capacity and planning to ensure it can be achieved.
- We have had a fractious relationship with production, with members of Tech Inc believing Production members have a lackadaisical attitude while Production members believe Tech Inc are trying to tell them how to do their jobs.

# Expected Challenges

- The new structure reinforces Siloing, with complete separation of functions. [Conway’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) will play a big part in how we develop systems as a result.
- The lack of Delivery & Product within the product teams needs the void filled somehow within Tech Inc. We have held a lot of responsibilities that the teams will now have to achieve themselves.
- Delivery & Product currently do a lot more than is likely visible from the outside. The teams still need this function in the same capacity to continue to operate.
- Deciding a set of processes or ways of working without those that are going to use them inputting from the beginning.
- Undoing the hard work and journey the teams have been on is likely to be demoralising

# Suggestions
- Create a cross-functional leadership team, covering the disciplines of Engineering, Product, Delivery, Support and Production, that operate across the departments in collaboration to enable change.
- Identify and train champions within the Product teams to take the day-to-day responsibilities of delivery/product to ensure they are still able to operate.
- Allow the processes and ways of working to be developed by those that will use them. [Create a the sense of urgency and vision for the need for change you’re looking for, and empower people to action that vision](https://getlucidity.com/strategy-resources/guide-to-kotters-8-step-change-model/).
- Learn about what Agile Methodologies do, what they focus on, and how the teams are currently working before dismissing it as not working and needing to change.
- Don’t take a one size fits all approach to delivery. Product Development is different from Civil Engineering projects. It takes rapid and regular feedback to achieve the desired value of a product’s creation, which is not promoted in traditional project management. There are situations where traditional may apply more, such as in the production ecosystem, but even these could be achieved with an Agile Methodology.
- Ensure there is understanding as to why the processes and practices have been put in place before trying to change them.

# Personal Concerns & Things you should know as my line-manager

- This reorganization doesn’t align with my desired career path. Though I’m flexible in achieving my goals, I have had a path in mind for several years and am anxious about being pigeonholed as just a project manager or someone that simply generates reports without being able to affect change.
- There are a few things to be aware of when managing me. I do not consider these negatives or disadvantages and am sharing this for early and full transparency.
	- I suffer from clinical depression and anxiety.
	- I am neurodivergent, being diagnosed with dyslexia and moderate ADHD.
	- I am not good with ambiguity, needing to be able to establish or identify clear paths and goals.
	- I don’t need to be told what to do or how to do it, but I do need goals and will likely come to you with ideas of goals for us to achieve.
	- I may challenge what I am told. This does not mean I believe I am right, and others are wrong, but may mean I haven’t been given a clear explanation backed with evidence and/or data that invalidates my concerns.

You will note from the background that I am not a traditional project manager. In Agile Methologies, the traditional project management role is facilitated by a combination of both the Product Owner and Scrum Master, or in De Beers this would be Product Manager and Delivery Manager, through split responsibilities. Many of the facets of traditional project management still exist in the space, such as management of risks and dependencies as well as deliverable planning and tracking, but some of these responsibilities have been shared between, for instance, Chris and I in the teams we’ve worked on together.

I appreciate that this is probably a much longer email than you had hoped to receive, but I wanted to take the time to get down some of the thoughts that have mattered to me. There is also likely more I haven’t thought about and have missed, which I’m sure will come up in conversation and 1-2-1s over time.

Let me know if you have any questions before tomorrow.
