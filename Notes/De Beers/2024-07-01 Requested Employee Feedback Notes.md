# What went well?
\[Redacted] showed constant technical leadership to \[their] team and support as a MHFA to \[their] colleagues. \[They] continued to be a key member of the product team leadership, ever organised and dependable, while being involved in much of the good work the team created through the first half of the year, either in reviewing or contributing to the creation of the \[Product] process and its surrounding facets. Through tough situations, \[they] continued to step up and be an example of what good looks like for the team, acting as mentor to those that needed help and guidance even if the case seemed fruitless, and approaching each occasion with a level-head and patience.

# What could be improved?
Very little of note that is purely the responsibility of \[Redacted].

To be incredibly picky, if questioned on something that is one of \[their]  strengths, such as organisation during the lab move, \[they] can occasionally become defensive in \[their] communication. I put this down to pride in \[their]  work or miscommunication through text more than any intent. It would also be nice to see/hear \[Redacted] being a thought leader within the CoP and leading our WoW, though this may be already happening and it just isn't transparent from the outside.

I would like to see \[Redacted] progress into the next steps of what \[they] deems \[their]  career path to be, and this is likely were the majority of improvement lies. There is little to nothing in day-to-day and I'd have \[Redacted] as a Tech Lead in any team I work with.

# How were the values demonstrated?
Safety - As tech lead, \[they] quickly stepped up to take responsibility of \[their]  part of the health & safety review through the first half of this year, owning the lab with no fuss and ensuring any missing documentation was available and complete.

Be Passionate - Constantly engaged and actively looking to share knowledge within the team. Great deal of care about the \[Product] product was obvious throughout H1

Pull Together - A vision of leadership, \[Redacted] regularly enabled the team to communicate across technical and non-technical boundaries to ensure everyone was pulling in the same direction

Build Trust - When unhappy, \[Redacted], in \[their]  own time, would discuss the frustration with openness and honesty, ultimately leading to trust within the team.

Show we care - \[Redacted] continues to be a MHFA and actively seeks to support those that \[they] sees are struggling. I have experienced this personally on a number of occasions.

Shape the future - Through the tail end of last year, \[Redacted] pushed to run our processes through production test scenarios and negotiated stretching but achievable targets that would push the team. Through adversity faced during this testing period at the beginning of the year, \[they] was pivotal to the progress that was made.
