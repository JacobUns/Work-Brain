# Problems
- Lack of collaborative design is causing miscommunication, single point dependencies and lack of [[Glossary#^Accountability|accountability]] within the team
- Unclear Roles & Responsibilities causing conflict
- Ivory Tower vs Collaborative Design feels black and white with little grey in the middle
	- This is due to the bias generated by providing potential solutions
- Vocalising frustration in the wrong way
	- [[Quotes#^2bb652|Criticize in Private, Praise in Public]] #personalDevelopment
	- [[Coaching]] rather than Teaching #personalDevelopment 
- Damaging the psychological safety within the team due to above
- Disengaged team members during meetings
- Non-functional constraints aren't clear to the team
- No written version of the functional requirements in Theme/Epic/Feature form
- Not release planning in detail based on written functional & non-functional requirements
- Time constraints being placed on team due to Laura's requesting dates ASAP
	- Example - Laura wanting clear deliveries and timeline for 2024, which Michele then used in communication to the team saying [[architecture]] needed to be decided by the end of the week potentially influencing (unintentionally) bias within the design.
- Communication barriers between Three Amigos causing friction
- Not directly answering questions
	- Example - Laura asking whether we were aware of the Stage Gate process being implemented by Martyn, with Michele answering about the rollout of the Agent onto machines.
- Separation of Development and Testing Efforts
	- This is partly due to Bond's lack of replacement & Hari only just starting to get up to speed
# Ideal Solution
- Define the scope in written form, either as an Epic or Feature level piece of work with measurable goals
- Design and Ideate as a team on potential solutions
	- Parallels here for [[Kotter's Model - 8 Steps to Change|Kotter's]]
- Do not put a solution in front of the team as part of this as it biases the conversation
- Use visualisation techniques rather than written word to generate the ideas
	- Sequence Diagrams, Process Flows, Architectural diagrams etc.
- Test within the same sprint as development
- Break work into smaller testable packages
- Release Plan the work based on the value delivered
- Use velocity and relative estimation to identify delivery timeline rather than time based estimation
- Identify user journeys for front-end work before scoping size
- Identify potential solutions to the problem before settling on one solution
- Breakdown work to encompass both dev and test and still be deliverable within a sprint.
