# About
This is the act of uncovering the unknown or verifying the assumptions that we have when developing a product. There are many frameworks or examples of execution for discovery, but they mostly fall into two categories, [[Solution Discovery|Solution]] and [[Opportunity Discovery|Opportunity]]. Some methods of discovery, such as [[Hackathons]] or [[Design Sprint|Design Sprints]], bridge the two categories as they are intended as ideation.
