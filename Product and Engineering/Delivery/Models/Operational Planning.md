A Project Management practice used to generate a daily, weekly or monthly business operation plan on a department level to achieve goals in the strategic plan. It can also be referred to as an Ops Plan for short.

Whereas the [[Strategic Plan]] should detail the what and why behind an organisation's goals in a multiyear period, an Operational Plans should detail how the business is going to achieve that in conjunction with its Product Roadmap.

In [[SAFe]], this looks to be similar to the [[Solution Roadmap]] as described [on the SAFe website](https://scaledagileframework.com/roadmap/). Compared with [[SAFe]], the Operational Plan would look to identify the contents of multiple PI Plans that integrate across multiple teams within an organisation, but where [[SAFe]] doesn't have an expected commitment for anything outside the current PI, Ops Plans (as they are timebound) will often cause the business to assume that the multiyear plan is accurate. This is impossible, as none of the people involved in developing the plan are clairvoyant.
