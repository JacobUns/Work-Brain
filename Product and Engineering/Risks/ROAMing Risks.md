## Resolved
When a risk is not considered a threat anymore and no action is to be taken it is considered Resolved.

## Owned
When a risk is still a threat, but no plan or action can be taken to remove the risk it is considered Owned. Someone is marked as responsible for doing something about that risk and reporting back to the group with any actions taken.

## Accepted
When a risk is still a threat, but nothing can be done to remove it, a group must agree that the risk is accepted and there may be problems encountered as a result.

## Mitigated
When a risk has a plan in place to resolve it, it is considered mitigated. The plan must be inspected to ensure that the mitigation is taking place. Typically, this mitigation plan would have been identified as part of whatever session is currently underway. If it can't be planned for, it is considered Owned and must have an owner assigned.
