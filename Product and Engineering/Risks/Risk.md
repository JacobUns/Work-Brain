# Mechanisms for Managing Risk
## RAID
Risks make up part of the [[Risks, Actions, Issues and Dependencies]] log, which is a mechanism of tracking the Risks, Assumptions, Issues and Dependencies experienced by a team. 
## ROAMing
[[ROAMing Risks]] is a practice used to quickly identify what is going to be done with a Risk.
# Types of Risk
## Operational
## Technical
## Regulatory
## Commercial
## Product
## Financial
## Legal
May include such types of risk as [[Intellectual Property#Patents|Patent]] or [[Intellectual Property]] infringement, the ability to acquire a patent based on the design for a product, or the risk of litigation being raised against your organisation to name a few. The majority of these risks are not handled by a [[product team]], but are instead handled by a legal team. They should, however, be tracked and maintained in the [[Risks, Actions, Issues and Dependencies]] log with the assistance of someone from Legal.
## Legislative
My include such risk as governing bodies changing the legislation that impacts user rights or how a company is allowed to operate, as was done with GDPR, that brings associated business risk.
