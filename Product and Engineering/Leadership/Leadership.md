# Leadership vs Management
Leadership is often confused with [[Line Management|Management]]. Though it is true that [[Line Management|Line Managers]] should exhibit leadership qualities, they are not one in the same. There are underlying biases that we all carry when we hear the term [[Line Management|Manager]], and these can very easily colour our perceptions when interfacing with people. Leadership is a quality many can exhibit daily with no specific [[Leadership#Power|Power]] being given to an individual.
## How do they differ?


# Types
## Influence
[[Servant-Leadership]] is an example of Leadership through Influence. [[Delivery Management|Delivery Managers]] and [[Product Management|Product Managers]], for example, are not given the responsibility of an individual but are often expected to lead them, creating a shared vision for change and enabling this to occur with minimal resistance. Leadership must be earned within this space through action, rather than given in the way of [[Leadership#Power|Power]]. Often, without realising, this method of can rely on methods like [[Kotter's Model - 8 Steps to Change|Kotter's 8 Steps to Change]] to generate buy-in and shared goals.
## Power
[[Line Management]] is an example of Leadership through Power, in that responsibility is granted to an individual by another individual. This may be a board of directors appointing a CEO, or a middle-manager appointing a supervisor, but the principal is the same; one person or group of people is delegating responsibility of certain actions to another. The associated expectation is that when a [[Line Management|Manager]] ask for something from their reports, that command is executed and the output produced.

# Styles
## Intent-based Leadership
David Marquet describes the concept of Intent-based leadership as part of the book [[Resources#^TurnTheShipAround|Turn the Ship Around]]. The concept revolves around enabling autonomy and empowerment in your surrounding team, and having them sanity check with you as required rather than taking a command and control approach. This was drastically different from the approach being used in the military by many commanding officers.

As a result of his leadership style, the U.S.S. Santa Fe, which was the submarine with the poorest reputation in the US Navy, became the leading performer in its class. As a result, Marquet went on to write multiple leadership books and become a thought leader in the area of leadership. #DavidMarquet
