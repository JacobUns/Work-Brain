## Resource Notes
Comes from the intent to enable User Experience Design to align with Development Teams running Agile Methodologies

2001 - Agile Introduced

-  Great for Engineering Teams, puts control back in their hands and stops things coming from top down
-  Awful for UX Team, became disconnected from the Engineers

Three Revelations

-  To serve agile, design had to become Agile
	-  UX has the same kind of loops but struggled to work together well
	-  Defined the principles that make Agile
		- Time-boxed
		- Iterative
		- Incremental
		- Collaborative
		- Conversational
		- Just-in-time
	- Not Two Teams
		- Two tracks, one team
		- Can't just put design work in the backlog and treat it like development work
			- Working Software is the only measure of success
		- Tried doing complete designs and redesign at the end of each sprint for coming change
		- Insights must be shared together
		- Devs have to be involved in the design
		- While Developers work on the designs, designers need to be involved to help adjust designs due to feasibility
- There's always friction between parts of the company that are Agile, and parts that aren't Agile
- Culture eats process for Breakfast
	- Trying to put a process where the culture doesn't match, the culture will always win
	- Practice grows in fertile soil
	- Find a place where people want to change
	- Find Champions, then clone
	- Beware of Heroes
	- Team is the hero
		- If there's 1 person who draws social standing from being a hero it can be poisonous, and may undermine the process
	- Who rules your roost?
		- Implementing new processes changes the power balance
	- Watch your incentives
		- Promote team work, not individuality
	- Use inclusion to maximize ROI of your diversity
		- Make better decisions for the business by including different people with different perspectives
		- Diversity is having the right people in the room, inclusion is your practices so they can all contribute fully
-   Choose your scrum masters wisely
	- Scrum Masters own the heart of the process
	- Choose people who really really care about making it work

[[Usability Testing]]
- Used to wait until you have something to test, create a prototype, plan a test, your protocol, recruit users, bring them in, run the test, write report about what went wrong
	- Not timeboxed
	- Don't know how long its going to take
	- Can be done iteratively
	- Doesn't really fit collaborative, conversational, just-in-time
-   Changed their practice
	- Instead of waiting until they had something to test they planned the test first
	- Every 2 weeks they would have a usability test and would pull people from their pool of users
	- After 2 weeks they'd show code from Devs and prototypes and show users
	- Bring together devs to watch
	- Define a list of most important issues to resolve, not all issues
		- When users start using the next iteration of the system, their behaviour will change and some of those issues may disappear

User Research
- Used to go to interview hundreds of users, generate personas, use cases and test reports etc.
	- Would take 3 months before building anything
	- Making big bet on next year of work
- Changed to talk to users regularly, always focusing on what's next.
	- Would still keep big artefacts like user journeys and personas updated as they went
	- Would talk about new insights during daily standup with development team

Design Specs
- Used to do long design specs
	- The longer your design spec, the less likely they are to read it
- Couple page doc
	- Pictures, callouts, conversation
	- Sit down with people and talk through the design

Comes from many names
-   Parallel Tracks
-   Staggered Sprints
-   Dual Track
