## Description
Story Mapping is a method of identifying the story an actor goes on through the execution of a job or interaction with a product, and from it identifying what work needs to go into the ideal outcome for each step.

It is a method of [[Solution Discovery]], as it assumes we already understand the problem to a degree that allows us to map the story. There will, however, likely be instances of [[Opportunity Discovery]] occurring throughout as we potentially identify unmet needs.
