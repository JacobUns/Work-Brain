# About
User Experience, or UX, is the discipline of researching and developing customer interactions with a product that enable intuitive and desired usage of a system. This is done through a number of mechanisms, including laws of human psychology, tried and tested methods used by market leaders, and user research among other methods.

The user experience is a key part of the [[Solution Discovery]] process, whereby we identify based on quantifiable data led decision making the most appropriate course of action for solving a user's problem.

There are two ways to view this role, one is as a [[Product Designer]], who closely collaborates with a [[Product Manager]] as part of the [[Discovery]] process, or as a User Experience Designer, who often generates a desirable and viable solution to be implemented by a [[Product Team]] based on requirements provided to them.

The [[Product Designer]] is the more desirable approach, in my view, as they have first-hand information rather than dilution that is prevalent when being provided this information second-hand. This is due to a reliance on the [[Product Manager]] or [[Scrum#Product Owner|Product Owner]] having a full appreciation of the problem, which may not be the case without a research or methodology based approach. It also builds accountability and clarity where it comes to designing a potential solution, as the [[Product Designer]] will likely feel more empowered to make decisions if they have been involved in the [[Discovery]] process.
