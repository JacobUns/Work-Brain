# About
 Six Sigma is a methodology and set of tools to improve business processes by reducing defects, errors, variation and increasing quality and efficiency. The ultimate goal is to reach a level of 3.4 defects per million opportunities.
# Model
![[Six Sigma Cycle.png]]

The model looks very similar to that of [[Lean]] [[Learning Test Cycles]], where instead of the fairly simple Build, Measure, Learn loop, we introduce two additional phases of improvement and control. Both Six Sigma and [[#Lean Six Sigma|Lean Six Sigma]] are used regularly in areas where critical reduction of defects exist, such as defense and government.
# Lean Six Sigma
Lean Six Sigma looks to combine the concepts of [[Lean]] with that of Six Sigma with the aim of increasing the speed at which the problems that are identified can be resolve, making for a faster and more efficient approach.
