# Description
[[Delivery]] metrics are indicators that provide insight into the health of a [[Product Team]] in both their ability to meet commitments on time and without putting the team into a state of stress. They should help understand whether the team is maturing or whether they are encountering problems that impact the [[product]] adversely.
# Types
## Velocity
The total sum of story points or completed items on average that a team can achieve within their sprint. Velocity is often used to gauge commitment for a sprint within [[Scrum]].

It should never be used by [[Line Management|Management]]/[[Leadership]] to compare two teams against each other, as [[Estimation#Story Points|Story Points]] between teams are likely to represent different sizes based on that teams context, experience and maturity.

Trend analysis can be done to understand whether velocity is increasing healthily as the team matures, or if there are any major problems to be aware of, but too much of a focus on this is unhealthy as its a metric that can easily be gamed by artificially inflating estimates.
## Lead Time
The total time required from creation to completion of a [[Work Item Types|Work Item]]. High lead time indicates that [[Work Item Types|Work Items]] age may be at an unhealthy level. This can be combined with the [[#Cumulative Flow]] metrics to understand whether the backlog is growing faster than items are being completed, and at what rate.
## Cycle Time
The total time required for a [[Work Item Types|Work Item]] that has been started to its completion. Within [[Scrum]], high cycle times that exceed the length of a sprint often indicate that commitments aren't being achieved. For example, if a sprint is 10 days long and the average cycle time is 15 days then this indicates that on average a story that is started in one sprint will not complete until the middle of the next sprint.
## Cumulative Flow
## Team Health
## Psychological Safety
## [[Agile]] Maturity
## Time
A really unreliable and often sought-after metric. Time is a precise and highly granular measurement that when used for the purpose of [[delivery]] often leads to under-estimating or overcommitting to work within a team. Time can be used on a task level for the purpose of tracking burndown within a sprint, but this is equally unreliable when relied on too heavily.

Humans are really bad at precise measurements, but are much better at relative [[Estimation]]. This is observable through the [[Weber-Fechner Law]], as the change in time is often so small we cannot easily perceive it, and therefore our ability to relatively estimate against it is significantly impaired.
