# Acronym
Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers, Requirements 
# About
Originates from the 1980s and is part of the "Total Quality Movement". It is used within the measure phase of Six Sigma, within Lean manufacturing and in different schools of process management.
# Purpose
SIPOC is used to illustrate a business process from beginning to end prior to implementing it. They can be used as a form of high level process map as they do not contain much detail. It helps define complex projects that may not be well scoped.
## Definitions
Suppliers - These are providers of the inputs to the process
Inputs - Resources that are required to complete the process, such as materials.
Process - A step-wise guide that converts the Input to an Output. It should be done in 4-5 high level steps
Outputs - The product or service that is created from the process
Customers - Recipients of any outputs
## Example
