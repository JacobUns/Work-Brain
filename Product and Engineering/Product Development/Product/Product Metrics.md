# Description
# Frameworks
## North Star
The North Star framework looks to provide guiding light for a [[product team]] to work against. The purpose of the framework is to help a team shape metrics that indicate whether the development they complete impacts the performance of their [[Product]]. 
### Product North Star
The Product North Star is meant to be the One Metric That Matters (OMTM). It gives insight into what matters above anything else at any point in time. 
### Key Influencers
### Levers

# Types
Similarly to [[Commercial]] disciplines, the [[Product]] domain also uses [[Leading Indicator|Leading]] and [[Lagging Indicator|Lagging]] indicators for determining the performance of the [[product]]. The [[Product Management]] role  will need to also understand, and potentially monitor, [[Commercial#Types of Metric|Commercial Metrics]] such as [[Return on Investment]] or [[Cost of Delay]] to judge what to act upon, prioritise or otherwise disregard. As the role ultimately has [[Glossary#^Accountability|accountability]] for their [[product]], they will likely also have understanding or input into the [[Pricing Strategy]], even if this is lead by one of the [[Commercial]] team.
