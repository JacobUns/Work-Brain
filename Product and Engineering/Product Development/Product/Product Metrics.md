# Description
# Types
## Predictive and Historic 
Similarly to [[Commercial]] disciplines, the [[Product]] domain also uses [[Leading Indicator|Leading]] and [[Lagging Indicator|Lagging]] indicators for determining the performance of the [[product]]. The [[Product Management]] role  will need to also understand, and potentially monitor, [[Commercial#Types of Metric|Commercial Metrics]] such as [[Return on Investment]] or [[Cost of Delay]] to judge what to act upon, prioritise or otherwise disregard. As the role ultimately has [[Glossary#^Accountability|accountability]] for their [[product]], they will likely also have understanding or input into the [[Pricing Strategy]], even if this is lead by one of the [[Commercial]] team.
## Vanity
These types of metrics feel good to the people that are measuring them, may make us happy to see the number change, or generally give our ego a boost, but ultimately don't tell us very much. Examples of this may include:
- Product Backlog Health
- No. of Code Reviews
	- Completing 100 code reviews but missing 100 bugs doesn't provide a positive outcome.
- Number of units created
	- Creating defective or low quality still counts towards creation.
- Unit Test Coverage
	- Creating tests for the sake of seeing the percentage number increase actually has the potential to make it harder to make development progress without providing value.
- Website hits
	- Users navigating to your page may indicate some level of traction, but if 99% of those users never make it off the homepage it doesn't indicate success.
## Proxy
These metrics may indicate the potential for success but don't ultimately directly evidence success. Examples of this may include:
- No. of downloads for content
	- This does not show whether the content was valuable to the user, or if they accidently downloaded five copies.
- No. of items added to baskets
	- Items added but never purchased don't show success for an e-commerce business.
- Page Views
	- This may indicate that people are getting to the page you want them to, but if they don't perform the actions or consume the content you're intending them to it doesn't show success.
## Business & Customer-orientated Metrics
These are the metrics that should be focused on. They indicate some level of concrete and evidence based success for the product. This may include increase in revenue, customer retention, customer acquisition etc.

# Frameworks
## North Star
The North Star framework looks to provide guiding light for a [[product team]] to work against. The purpose of the framework is to help a team shape metrics that indicate whether the development they complete impacts the performance of their [[Product]]. 
### Product North Star
The Product North Star is meant to be the One Metric That Matters (OMTM). It gives insight into what matters above anything else at any point in time. Often, this may be a combination of Reach, Engagement and Frequency factors.

Example for how this could be applied for Netflix:

Good North Star Metrics will also likely have three attributes:
1. It measures the moment that a customer finds value from your product
2. It represents the core of your product strategy
3. It is a leading (not lagging) indicator of a future business outcome the company cares about
