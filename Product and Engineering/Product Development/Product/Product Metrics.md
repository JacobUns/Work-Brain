Similarly to [[Commercial]] disciplines, the [[Product]] domain also uses [[Leading Indicator|Leading]] and [[Lagging Indicator|Lagging]] indicators for determining the performance of the [[product]]. The [[Product Manager]] role is will need to also understand and potentially monitor [[Commercial#Types of Metric|Commercial Metrics]] such as [[Return on Investment]] or [[Cost of Delay]] to judge what to act upon, prioritise or otherwise disregard. As the role ultimately has accountability for their [[product]], they will likely also have understanding or input into the [[Pricing Strategy]], even if this is lead by one of the [[Commercial]] team.
