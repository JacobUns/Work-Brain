# Description
Story Mapping is a method of identifying the story an actor goes on through the execution of a job or interaction with a product, and from it identifying what work needs to go into the ideal outcome for each step.

It is a method of [[Solution Discovery]], as it assumes we already understand the problem to a degree that allows us to map the story. There will, however, likely be instances of [[Opportunity Discovery]] occurring throughout as we potentially identify unmet needs.

## Guidance
### How long does this take?
In the below workshop examples, the team took approximately 6 hours to get to the end result after a false start. Putting a day in for the first time is not unreasonable depending on the size of the work the team is looking to undertake.
### Process
#### Step 1 - Introduction
Run an example through the team. This could be anything from getting out of bed and getting ready to leave for work through to going on holiday. The scenario doesn't really matter, what does matter is the process is followed. 
#### Step 2 - Generate the story
Generate the high level steps of what needs to be undertaken. The aim is to almost turn event into a stepwise process-flow. You should be able to read it from left to right as if it were telling you a story.
#### Step 3 - Generate the detailed steps
Each step will have a level of detail that is needed to fully execute it. These are the story-level items. These can be aspirational things that you'd like to do if possible down to the critical aspects that are non-negotiable.
#### Step 4 - Rollup the themes
There are likely to be themes in the story that denote sections of activity. These can be rolled up to illustrate the epics that we looking to be achieved, and therefore detailed as such.
#### Step 5 - Cut the [[Release Planning|releases]]
Once we have the story identified with all its different parts, we can start slicing down the backlog of work into [[Release Planning|Releases]]. These can be themed, and should ultimately start with the most critical areas to deliver value to a customer as soon as possible.
