# About
Similar to a [[Team Working Agreement]] for a [[Product Team]], the Project Charter lays out the rules of engagement for a project with its stakeholders. As part of this process, the [[Product Management|Product]] or [[Delivery Management|Delivery Manager]] lay out clearly the Goals, Timeframe, People, Environment and other elements that are pivotal to the success of the associated project.

The resulting artefact should be explicitly agreed to by the stakeholders and team involved in the development of the project. The purpose of this document is to ensure the accountability of the team but also protect them from any deviations in scope, so explicit written agreement enables the [[Product Team]] to point to it as an artefact in the event someone claims or pushes for capabilities that were not scoped.
