# About
Design Failure Mode Effect Analysis (DFMEA) . It is a process that originates from [[Mechanical Engineering]] which aims to identifying possible error and failure modes of a part or component that is in development. The general concept is to identify problems before they come to pass, enabling the engineer to design flaws out of the manufactured part, thereby saving cost.
