# About
Software Engineering is the discipline or domain that covers all aspects of development towards software products, mostly consisting of the development of code but also encompasses all supporting competencies, such as [[DevOps#Practices|DevOps Practices]], testing practices such as [[Test Driven Development]], testing approaches such as [[Automation Testing |Automation]] and [[Manual Testing]], version control with [[Repositories]], and different approaches to [[Architecture]].

The main competency of Software Engineering is the development of, unsurprisingly, software programming and scripting. Software often takes many guises, whether it be the very visible Front-end development or not visible, but core of a system, in Backend. Even in the world of systems maintenance, as [[DevOps]] becomes a more widely adopted approach, we see code play its part, with such concepts as [[DevOps#Infrastructure as Code|Infrastructure as Code]] becoming more prevalent for its flexibility and disaster recovery enablement.
# Disciplines
## Front-end Development
This is the discipline of developing customer facing applications, most commonly using a mixture of [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Javascript]].
## Backend Development
## Database Development
One of the core components to successful systems and architecture is the infrastructure behind the services, which will usually be a [[Databases|database]] of some variety.
# Practices
[[Version Control]]
## Principles
[[Normalization]]
[[SOLID Principles|SOLID]]
[[Object Orientated Programming]]
# Metrics
There are many types of [[Software Engineering Metrics]] to be aware of, but fundamentally they all boil down to the same thing which is to monitor the performance, complexity and maintainability of a solution. Some metrics from other disciplines such as [[Product Metrics]] may have an impact on decisions made, but these are not specifically engineering based metrics.
