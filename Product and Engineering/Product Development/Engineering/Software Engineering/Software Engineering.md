# About
Software Engineering is the discipline or domain that covers all aspects of development towards software products, mostly consisting of the development of code but also encompasses all supporting competencies, such as [[DevOps#Practices|DevOps Practices]], testing practices such as [[Test Driven Development]], testing approaches such as [[Automation Testing |Automation]] and [[Manual Testing]], version control with [[Repositories]], and different approaches to [[Architecture]].

The main competency of Software Engineering is the development of, unsurprisingly, software programming and scripting. Software often takes many guises, whether it be the very visible [[Front-End Software|Front-end]] development or not visible, but core of a system, in [[Backend Software|Backend]]. Even in the world of systems maintenance, as [[DevOps]] becomes a more widely adopted approach, we see code play its part, with such concepts as [[DevOps#Infrastructure as Code|Infrastructure as Code]] becoming more prevalent for its flexibility and disaster recovery enablement.
