## Infrastructure as Code
In the last 10 years a new role has emerged in the space of [[Software Engineering]] due to the developments in the DevOps space. This role, known as a [[Platform Engineering|Platform Engineer]], is responsible for managing and maintaining the infrastructure of system that they have developed. Through the use of containerisation and software languages designed for the purpose, a [[Platform Engineering|Platform Engineer]] can create systems that remove the need for a company to have bare-metal hardware such as server-racks or data centres.

As a result, companies have been able to start selling their code as a [[product]] in its own right, taking either an [[Infrastructure as a Service]] or [[Platform as a Service]] sales model.
