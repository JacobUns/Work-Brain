Measurement of the maturity of an organisation is a good first step when joining the business. One way of doing this is by leveraging the tooling in [[Scaled Agile Framework for enterprise|SAFe]] with their DevOps Assessment.

# DevOps Assessment
The [DevOps Assessment](https://v5.scaledagileframework.com/blog/assess-your-devops-health-with-the-safe-devops-radar/) looks at 4 key areas:
- Continuous Exploration
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- [[Release on Demand]]

The approach on the assessment is to use a compass graph to map the points. This can then be used to show visible improvement as areas stretch.

It is possible, at minimum, to map the competencies on a board such as Miro or Lucid and then track whether steps have been taken on each of those different criteria to push to the next level. This is a low tech solution, but a good starting place.
