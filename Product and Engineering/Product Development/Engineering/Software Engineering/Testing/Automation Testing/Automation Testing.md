# About
The practice of Automation testing is an implementation of [[Lean#Muda (Lean Waste)|Lean Waste]] reduction. [[Quality Assurance|Testing]] practices primarily focused on [[Manual Testing|Manual Test]] creation and execution through a large portion of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The problem with [[Manual Testing]] is once it has been executed manually, it must be executed manually again every time a change is made which causes significant duplication of effort.

It was partly due to this that [[Systems Development Life Cycle]] like [[Waterfall]] caused businesses to attempt to wait for all development to be completed before executing tests, as execution of the [[Quality Assurance#Test Suites|Test Suites]] would become more and more laborious as development went on, and would require more and more people to achieve the testing required to release a solution.

With more of a presence of [[DevOps]] practices for automation of infrastructure, [[Quality Assurance|QAs]] and [[Software Engineering|Software Engineers]] started to look for ways to reduce the effort required to validate their solution did what they believed it should. This also came at a time where [[Lean]] and [[Agile]] methodologies were becoming more mainstream, and the need for rapid feedback loops made the [[Manual Testing]] approach prohibitive to achieving this.

# Frameworks
## Selenium
This is a widely used Automation Framework for Web Applications and automation of Web Interfaces. It's a [[C#]] Framework, and with the name and heritage of .NET languages carries a significant market share of businesses. Microsoft's Selenium framework evolved from the Awesomium library developed by Google to drive web interfaces, wrapping the technology in .NET concepts and familiarity when compared to the more experimental at the time Awesomium. Since its creation, Selenium has become the top name in Automation Testing Frameworks, simply due to the popularity and familiarity of the language it is based on, enabling [[Software Engineering|Software Engineers]] to more easily add to and maintain the [[Quality Assurance#Test Suites|Test Suites]].
## Cypress
## Playwright
## TestCafe
## Puppeteer
Puppeteer is an automation tool that has now been superseded by Cypress, as Cypress was based on the same technology. It is a [[Javascript#Node.js|Node.js Javascript]] framework that became prominent around the same time as the advent of [[DevOps]] practices. I have no personal experience of this framework, but its prominence in the industry for an extended period speaks to its capabilities
## Robot
Robot Test Framework is a Python based automation tool for building out a suite of tests. Enables the use of [[Behaviour Driven Development#Gherkin|Gherkin]] within the code. The last experience I had with this would be at Audatex between 2016 and 2019. The development team were not complementary of it after it was introduced having previously been using [[C#]] and a custom built framework by a former contractor, though I put this down to inexperience with the framework, the change in language, and the general lack of appetite for change.
