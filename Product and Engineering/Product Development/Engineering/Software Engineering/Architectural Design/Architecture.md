# About
As with civil engineering, building [[Software Engineering|software]] that will last for years to come and is easy to maintain and expand requires forethought and planning, and therefore the discipline is a skill in its own right.  
# Forms of Architecture
## Software Architecture
This form of architectural design focuses on a unit of software and how it is going to operate and interact. It could be considered [[Solitary Test|Solitary]] in the same way that Unit Tests can be [[Sociable Test|Sociable]] or [[Solitary Test|Solitary]]. The focus is purely on how does this unit of software need to work and the components it's going to be made from. This is a discipline that becomes more important as there becomes a bigger focus on [[Architecture#Micro-services|Micro-service]] architectures as more [[Software Engineering|Software Engineers]] start to pick up responsibilities for architectural design.
## Solutions Architecture
This form of architectural design focuses on the interaction between modules of software and how they need to communicate in a performant manner. In contrast to Software Architecture, this can only be [[Sociable Test|Sociable]] in its approach and could be compared to [[Integration Testing]] as a concept.
## Enterprise Architecture
This form of architectural design focuses on Solutions architecture at scale. It is much less worried about the intricacies of each individual piece of software and instead looks to combine and solutions into an integrated environment without causing friction throughout.
# Types
## Domain Driven Design
Also known as DDD
## Micro-services

# UML
Most architecture is done using diagrams that use a common format for communicating concepts between developers to 
- [[C4  Diagram]]
- [[Class Diagram]]
- [[Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)]]
- [[Process Flow Diagram]]
- [[Sequence Diagram]]
