# Definition
The act of hiding away the complexity of an implementations working from a consumer of an object. Part of the [[Object Orientated Programming]] paradigm, the practice of abstracting code is primarily to simplify implementation as much as possible.

Examples of Abstraction are everywhere, and the languages you likely use to write code will use them without you even realising. Libraries that you use to implement common functions, core parts of any high level high-level programming language, and even every day objects like a coffee machine are all examples of abstraction. You don't need to know the exact temperature or quantity of water, the number of beans or perfect level of pressure required to make a coffee when you press a button on a machine, as it has been created with the intention of hiding this complexity from you.
