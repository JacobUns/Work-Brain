# About
Often used in conjunction with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], HTML is a web markup language for [[Software Engineering#Front-end Development|Front-End Development]] that describes the structure of a page to be displayed using something called Tags. This is interpreted by a web browser and converted into a graphical representation for the user. Through use of languages like [[Javascript]], this graphical representation can be made significantly more powerful and interactive to a user, thereby improving the [[User Experience]] and likelihood someone will return to use the application again.
# Resources
[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) provide very useful and user friendly explanations of the different tags and how to implement them.
