# Summary
The Chimp Paradox is a book written by Professor Steve Peters, a professor in Psychology. The book outlines a mind model that separates the human brain into three main domains: The Human, The Chimp and The Computer. Each of these domains has their own role where it comes to human survival and fulfillment. The Chimp represents the anthropological origins of our species that deals with emotion, The Human represents the the logic and reason, and the Computer which deals with automated tasks and retrieve and store operation.
