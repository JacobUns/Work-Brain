- Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
- Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
- Adapting to Change over Following a Plan

## Detail
The agile values provide an insight into what the priority should be when delivering projects. The items on the left are the priority, and when crunch time comes they are the things that matter. We prioritise those, over the things on the right, but we still do a lot of those things on the right.

As an example, the fourth value is adapting to change over following a plan, but in agile methodologies we typically plan more than any other way of working. Planning takes a different form, and instead of long meetings regularly to cover project plans and next priorities, we do smaller bursts with specific goals and intentions ranging from daily to bi-weekly or monthly.
