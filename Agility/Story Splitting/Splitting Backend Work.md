Spend time understanding what the problem space is first. Do some discovery and understand what we're trying to achieve if the split of work isn't obvious.

Although a lot of people look at Agility and splitting out architectural design as an antipattern, when a team has very little expertise using these types of pattern it doesn't happen organically as part of delivery.

Perfect vertical story splitting works when a mature team is picking up the work, or has individuals with enough experience using atypical design practices naturally. It starts to fall down when expecting teams that don't have experience using design practices like architectural diagramming, and those teams tend to start with code first, and eventually leads to tech debt.

## Examples
### Insendi, Authorisation
Identified there were too many horizontal splits of work
Identified we could define some architecture up front ([[Discovery]])
Decided to focus on replacing a single permission

Split by Resource Permission

### Insendi, Dark Launching
Implementing code without planning.
Picked out through a stand-up, being unable to identify what was left
Spent time on architectural conversation and created sequence diagrams

Could split the discovery by Flow of code.
Split into 4 stories:
- Empty Service
- Function to retrieve from a third-party vendor and story locally in cache
	- Testable through logging metrics generated by the system
- Function to evaluate user identity and details against cache
- Integration of the feature flagging mechanism into a solution
