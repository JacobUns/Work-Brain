# About
Many [[Agile]] methodologies, and even some operations teams that don't follow a methodology, have come to adopt a practice similar to daily stand-ups. The practice comes from [[Extreme Programming|XP]], and, in the spirit of the methodology, it looks to provide an opportunity for members of the team to feedback on the development that has taken place in the last 24-hour period.

Traditionally, the meeting looks to answer three questions but doesn't prescribe a mechanism for answering them. Those questions are:
1) What have I done since the last stand-up?
2) What am I planning to do until the next stand-up?
3) What blockers are in my way that could affect the plan?

The point of this meeting is to be brief and provide feedback quickly to the other members of the meeting. What was observed by those that started the trend towards stand-up meetings was when everyone goes into meeting rooms and sits in comfortable chairs, the observable effect is that these meetings run on longer than is needed. This ultimately cuts into the available productive time in a day that can then start to lead people to believe that meetings get in the way of them achieving their tasks, even if they themselves are a contributing factor.

To combat this, the practice of standing was introduced to the meeting to make people uncomfortable and therefore create the want to finish the meeting as soon as possible. Some companies go as far as having designated areas for stand-ups which have slightly uneven floors to enhance the discomfort level. This is unnecessary, but it does find a way to encourage the practice of brevity.

Importantly, the stand-up is held at the exact same time and in the exact same place so that everyone can ensure their timely appearance for the brief session. As it is intended to be brief, any poor time keeping can eat into the team's day unnecessarily. People, generally speaking, do not like conflict. We, therefore, have a tendency to wait for everyone to be together before starting so we don't upset someone we work with regularly, avoid the conflict of trying to make that person change their behaviour, or have to waste more time getting that person up to speed with things they've missed. This has the same effect as sitting in the meeting; the meeting length drags on and people get upset that meetings are unproductive and stop them being able to achieve their work. In this example, it is not the meeting itself that is causing the problem, but the people involved in it not being prepared enough 

Methodologies like [[Scrum]] have come to introduce the concept into their ways of working but have change the name. [[Scrum]]'s equivalent is known as the [[Scrum#Daily Scrum|Daily Scrum]] and often gets renamed due to the popularity of the practice from [[Extreme Programming|XP]].
# Anti-patterns
There are some notable problems that are worth being aware of with this practice. Most of these stem from individuals not paying attention to what each other are saying for many potential reasons, and finding the cause of this will help the team to find a resolution to get the most out of their feedback. If these anti-patterns occur, it may be worth addressing these directly as part of a [[Scrum#Sprint Retrospective|team retrospective]] to find a solution that works for everyone.

If an approach of asking the three questions of each member of the team directly is taken, an anti-pattern can occur where the members of the team do not pay attention to what each other are saying. This is due to each person likely wanting to feel prepared for what they are going to say, and then being relieved when their turn is over. This defeats the point of the stand-up, as it should be a collaborative meeting where each member looks to understand how the team as a whole is looking to achieve their plans and provide each other support or an alternative viewpoint where possible.

You may also come to observe that some members aren't paying attention for other reasons, one of which may be that the content of the team's discussion is in no way relevant to their activities. This can highlight potential silos of work, an improper formation of the team, or simply that individuals are inattentive for another reason. Holding each member to account is important, and there should be enough [[Psychological Safety]] in a mature team to call-out where these problems are occurring.

Another example of an anti-pattern is side conversations within the team. As an example, one person may explain a blocker they are encountering and someone else in the team offers to help resolve it. The stand-up continues, and while others are feeding back to the team, the two start to talk about the problem in detail. At this point, the two members have stopped listening and may miss important information that affects their plans. Finding mechanisms for ensuring this doesn't happen is important to the quality of the plans being created by the team.

Finally, some teams end up confusing the purpose of the meeting with that of a reporting session. Instead of planning their next actions, they simply tell each other what they are doing or have done and make no attempts to collaborate with each other to improve the quality of what they produce in the next 24-hour period. This is a wasted opportunity as well as a waste of everyone's time, as inspection with out adaptation is wasteful as is described in the [[Scrum]] guide.
