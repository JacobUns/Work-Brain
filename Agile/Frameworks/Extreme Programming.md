# About
E**X**treme **P**rogramming, or XP as it's commonly known, is another [[Agile]] framework based on the concept of regular feedback. Extreme Programming looks to shorten the review and feedback loop as much as possible to eliminate as many future issues as possible. This includes such practices as [[Release Planning]], [[Acceptance Testing]] and [[Pair Programming]], and is the origin of some of the most commonly used practices in all [[Agile]] frameworks such as [[Daily Stand-up]] and [[User Stories]].
