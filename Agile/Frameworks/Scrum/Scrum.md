# About
Scrum is an [[Agile]] framework that embodies the [[Agile#Principles|Agile Principles]] and [[Agile#Values|Values]] created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in the early 1990s. With foundations in [[Lean]] and [[Agile]], the framework provides guidance on ways of operating that improves our ability to communicate with and deliver value to customers. A lot of the content in this page can be found in the Scrum guide which is freely available and can be found in the [[#Resources]] section of this document.
# Empiricism
This is the theory that all learning comes from experience and observation. It argues that Empiricism is a more reliable way of finding the truth as apposed to pure logical reasoning. It effectively speaks to the concept of [[Learning Test Cycles#Experiments|Experimentation]], as per the etymology of the word coming from the Greek "empeiria" and Latin "experientia" from which the English words [[Learning Test Cycles#Experiments|Experiment]] and Experience are derived. Followers of Empiricism argue it is the best way to learn, as logical reasoning may miss scenarios due to unknown factors being presented during the [[Learning Test Cycles#Experiments|experiment]].
# Principles & Values
As with [[Agile]], Scrum also has its own set of Principles and Values. These are derived from the foundations of [[Lean]] and [[Agile]] together, and talk to the culture of a team and its practices rather than of the methodology itself. It is possible to execute the Scrum framework in a command and control fashion, but, similar to understanding the [[Agile]] mindset, a team will produce better results by creating buy-in to the mindset and therefore accountability in a team's practices.
## Principles
The scrum framework, similar to the [[Extreme Programming|XP]] model, is designed for fast feedback which requires a few key elements to be possible. These are known as the Three Pillars of Empiricism and make up the principles of Scrum.
### Transparency
The first pillar is the foundation and enabler of the other two. Transparency in our practices, processes, work, progress, thinking and direction are important for development teams to make decisions that are sustainable for the future.

The Scrum guide has this to say on Transparency:

>The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts. Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
>
>Transparency enables inspection. Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

This links to the concept in [[Lean]] and [[Six Sigma#Lean Six Sigma|Lean Six Sigma]] of reducing [[Lean#Muda (Lean Waste)|waste]]. In traditional methodologies like [[Waterfall]], our practices and processes often result in a lot of waste due to reworking content that has been developed. This waste could have been addressed earlier with the right level of transparency and feedback. This waste regularly occurs due to siloing between functions and a lack of feedback throughout the process of development.
### Inspection
When we investigate and look for improvement in what we do we inspect all facets of the approach from inputs to processing and its output. The goal here is for continuous improvement. 

The Scrum guide has this to say on Inspection:
> The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.
> 
> Inspection enables adaptation. Inspection without adaptation is considered pointless. Scrum events are designed to provoke change.

#### Product Backlog Items
Scrum refers to items to be developed against a [[product]] as "Product Backlog Items", often shortened to PBI. Scrum does not have a definition of what needs to be in the backlog to a detailed level, and so many look to other frameworks for examples. The most commonly used formats are [[Work Item Types#Bug|Bugs]] and [[User Stories]], with higher levels being known by many names, including [[Work Item Types#Feature|Features]], [[Work Item Types#Epic|Epics]], [[Work Item Types#Initiatives/Themes|Initatives and Themes]], and [[Work Item Types#Capabilities|Capabilities]].
