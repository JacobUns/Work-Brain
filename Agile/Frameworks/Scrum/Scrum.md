#### Product Backlog Items
Scrum refers to items to be developed against a [[product]] as "Product Backlog Items", often shortened to PBI. Scrum does not have a definition of what needs to be in the backlog to a detailed level, and so many look to other frameworks for examples. The most commonly used formats are [[Bugs]] and [[User Stories]], with higher levels being known by many names, including [[Features]], [[Epics]], [[Initiatives]], [[Themes]] and [[Capabilities]].
