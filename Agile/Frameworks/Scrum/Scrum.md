# About
Scrum is an [[Agile]] framework that embodies the [[Agile#Principles|Agile Principles]] and [[Agile#Values|Values]] created by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in the early 1990s. With foundations in [[Lean]] and [[Agile]], the framework provides guidance on ways of operating that improves our ability to communicate with and deliver value to customers.
# Empiricism
This is the theory that all learning comes from experience and observation. It argues that Empiricism is a more reliable way of finding the truth as apposed to pure logical reasoning. It effectively speaks to the concept of [[Learning Test Cycles#Experiments|Experimentation]], as per the etymology of the word coming from the Greek empeiria and Latin experientia from which the English words Experiment and Experience are derived. Followers of Empiricism argue it is the best way to learn, as logical reasoning may miss scenarios due to unknown factors being presented during the experiment.

#### Product Backlog Items
Scrum refers to items to be developed against a [[product]] as "Product Backlog Items", often shortened to PBI. Scrum does not have a definition of what needs to be in the backlog to a detailed level, and so many look to other frameworks for examples. The most commonly used formats are [[Work Item Types#Bug|Bugs]] and [[User Stories]], with higher levels being known by many names, including [[Work Item Types#Feature|Features]], [[Work Item Types#Epic|Epics]], [[Work Item Types#Initiatives/Themes|Initatives and Themes]], and [[Work Item Types#Capabilities|Capabilities]].
