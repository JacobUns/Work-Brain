# About
In an #AgileFramework such as [[Scrum]] that runs [[Scrum#Sprints|Sprints]], there are sometimes opportunities to complete some activities the team otherwise wouldn't be able to due to their completing all work committed for the [[Scrum#Sprints|Sprint]]. These should only be done when all activities required to meet the [[Scrum#Definition of Done|Definition of Done]] on the [[Scrum#Commitment|Commitment]] have been completed.
# Activities
- Look forward in the backlog and refine any of the upcoming work, or plan for designs
- Pull a story that meets the [[Scrum#Definition of Ready|Definition of Ready]] into the the sprint
- Participate in some form of [[Discovery]] in preparation for an upcoming [[Scrum#Sprints|Sprint]]
