# About
[**S**caled **A**gile **F**ramework for **e**nterprise](https://scaledagileframework.com/) (SAFe) is a framework for operating lots of teams on a release train in an [[Agile]], organised and planned manner.

A lot of concepts are covered in the tooling of SAFe including prescription of models and frameworks to employ. It uses many of the concepts from other frameworks, such as [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]], [[DevOps]] and project management frameworks like [[PRINCE2]], and combines them to form something that is intended to work at an enterprise level; as such, it is likely the case that in most organisations this is inappropriate for execution, and that there are instead organisational problems that are blocking the adoption of [[Agile]]. Though SAFe practices may highlight some of these, they are unlikely to be a long term solution without generating waste.
