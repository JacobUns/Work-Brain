# About
Agility is a mindset made up of [[Agile Values|Values]] and [[Agile Principles|Principles]] that guide the way we work together as a team. It, in itself, is not a methodology so much as a way of thinking that has been exemplified in a number of Agile Methodologies including [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]], [[Scaled Agile Framework for enterprise|SAFe]], [[Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)|LeSS]], [[Crystal Methodology|Crystal]], [[Extreme Programming|XP]] and other such frameworks. For any of these frameworks or methodologies to be successful an organisation needs to develop or change its [[Culture]] to enable [[Self-Organisation]], [[Cross-functionality]] and [[Empowerment]] of its employees.

# Agile Transformation
Many organisations have embarked on Agile Transformations believing that agility will allow their business to operate in a healthier fashion. Though this can be true, execution needs to be carefully considered and requires the participants to be brought on the journey rather than dictated to. Adopting a methodology like [[Scrum]] in a command and control style will often lead to resistance and failure.

In a successful transformation, often [[Tuckman's Model]] can be observed in teams that are newly coming together in a [[Cross-functionality|cross-functional]] and [[Self-Organisation|self-organising]] manner. Following a methodology for change can help smooth this, such as [[Kotter's Model - 8 Steps to Change|Kotter's 8 steps to change model]], where creating a shared vision for why the change is necessary with key players is important to create buy-in. This model exemplifies the research done on Adoption curves which resulted in the book [[Diffusion of innovations]] by Everett Rogers.
