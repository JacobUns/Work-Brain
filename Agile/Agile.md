# About
Agility is a mindset made up of [[#Values]] and [[#Principles]] that guide the way we work together as a team. It, in itself, is not a methodology so much as a way of thinking that has been exemplified in a number of Agile Methodologies including [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]], [[Scaled Agile Framework for enterprise|SAFe]], [[Large Scale Scrum (LeSS)|LeSS]], [[Crystal Methodology|Crystal]], [[Extreme Programming|XP]] and other such frameworks. For any of these frameworks or methodologies to be successful an organisation needs to develop or change its [[Culture]] to enable [[Self-Organisation]], [[Cross-functionality]] and [[Empowerment]] of its employees.

# Values
- **Individuals and Interactions** over Processes and Tools
- **Working Software** over Comprehensive Documentation
- **Customer Collaboration** over Contract Negotiation
- **Adapting to Change** over Following a Plan
## Detail
The [[Agile]] values provide an insight into what the priority should be when delivering projects. The items on the left are the priority, and when crunch time comes they are the things that matter. We prioritise those, over the things on the right, but we still do a lot of those things on the right.

As an example, the fourth value is adapting to change over following a plan, but in [[Agile]] methodologies we typically plan more than any other way of working. Planning takes a different form, and instead of long meetings regularly to cover project plans and next priorities, we do smaller bursts with specific goals and intentions ranging from daily to bi-weekly or monthly.
# Principles
- The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous [[delivery]] of valuable software
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. [[Agile]] processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
- Working software is the primary measure of progress ^WorkingSoftwarePrinciple
- [[Agile]] processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
- Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from [[Self-Organisation|self-organising]] teams
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly
# Agile Transformation
Many organisations have embarked on Agile Transformations believing that agility will allow their business to operate in a healthier fashion. Though this can be true, execution needs to be carefully considered and requires the participants to be brought on the journey rather than dictated to. Adopting a methodology like [[Scrum]] in a command and control style will often lead to resistance and failure.

In a successful transformation, often [[Tuckman's Model]] can be observed in teams that are newly coming together in a [[Cross-functionality|cross-functional]] and [[Self-Organisation|self-organising]] manner. Following a methodology for change can help smooth this, such as [[Kotter's Model - 8 Steps to Change|Kotter's 8 steps to change model]], where creating a shared vision for why the change is necessary with key players is important to create buy-in. This model exemplifies the research done on Adoption curves which resulted in the book [[Diffusion of innovations]] by Everett Rogers.
