# Weber's Law
Simple differential sensitivity is inversely proportional to the size of the components of the difference; relative differential sensitivity remains the same regardless of size.

## Layman's terms
The perceived change in stimuli is proportional to the initial stimuli.

## Just Noticeable Difference (JND)
The smallest change in stimuli that can be perceived.

## Problems
Weber's law always fails at low intensities, near and below the absolute detection threshold, and often also at high intensities, but may be approximately true across a wide middle range of intensities.

# Fechner's Law
The relationship between stimulus and perception is logarithmic. The logarithmic relationship means that if a stimulus varies as a geometric progression (multiplied by a fixed factor), the corresponding perception is altered in an arthmetic progression (in additive constant amounts). For example, if a stimulus is tripled in strength, the corresponding perception may be two times as strong as its original value. If the stimulus is again tripled, the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value. 

## Problems
Similar to Weber's law, Fechner's law fails at low intensity.
