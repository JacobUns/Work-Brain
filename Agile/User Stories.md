# About
User stories are a method of conveying conversations held with users or internally as a development team. The practice comes from [[Extreme Programming|XP]],

### Acceptance Criteria
## Types
In the core definition of the practice for [[Extreme Programming|XP]], there is no differentiation between types of user story. In most organisations, this is completely fine and keeps the concept simple. In frameworks like [[Scaled Agile Framework for enterprise|SAFe]], however, there is differentiation between types of story to try and help the breakdown of work caused by interdependent teams.
### Feature User Stories
These types of story directly contribute to the value delivered to a user. Something a user touches at any point which provides them value, whether behind the scenes or at their finger tips, can be considered a feature user story.
### Enabler User Stories
To enable the breakdown of work into regularly deliverable chunks, and to break down cross-team dependencies, a team may be required to deliver stories that provide no user value but ultimately delivers value to the engineering team. An example of this would be setting up the foundations for a new set of infrastructure, including new [[Micro-service Architecture]], pipelines and [[Repositories]]

# Theory

## 3C's
The 3Cs is a concept to convey the most important parts of a user story. They are:
- Card
- Conversation
- Confirmation

The 3Cs are described by Ron Jefferies, the creator of [[Extreme Programming|XP]] to illustrate

## Persona-centric
The most common form of writing User Stories that is taught puts the persona at the core of the message. Users are the people who have problems that need to be solved by a [[Product]], so we use language that puts them front-and-centre in a development team's mind. 

As a... **[[Persona]]**
I want... **Proposition**
So that... **Value Statement**

Both Persona and Value centric approaches use pronouns to shift the reader's thought processes to be more empathetic. Mike Cohn explains that one of the things that made bands like The Beatles popular was their use of the pronouns I and You in their music, which took the listener into a mindset of empathy and imagination. Similar is true of this format of user story writing. By use of pronouns, we put the reader into a mindset of trying to empathise with the problem being experienced by the [[Persona]].
