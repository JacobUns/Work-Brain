User stories are a method of conveying conversations held with users or internally as a development team. The practice comes from [[Extreme Programming|XP]],

## Types
In the core definition of the practice for [[Extreme Programming|XP]], there is no differentiation between types of user story. In most organisations, this is completely fine and keeps the concept simple.

These types of story directly contribute to the value delivered to a user. Something a user touches at any point which provides them value, whether behind the scenes or at their finger tips, can be considered a feature user story.
### Enabler User Stories
To enable the breakdown of work into regularly deliverable chunks, and to break down cross-team dependencies, a team may be required to deliver stories that provide no user value but ultimately delivers value to the engineering team. An example of this would be setting up the foundations for a new set of infrastructure, including new [[Architecture#Micro-services|Micro-services]], piplines and [[Repositories]]

The most common form of writing User Stories that is taught puts the persona at the core of the message. Users are the people who have problems that need to be solved by a [[Product]], so we use language that puts them front-and-centre in a development team's mind.
