# About
T-Shaped individuals can be found in any disciple or job area. Typically, these people have a broad set of skills that they've picked up through study and experience over several years with one deep specialism where they hold a lot of knowledge.

# In Practice
## Software
Software is one of the most common domains where [[Cross-functionality#T-Shaped|T-Shaping]] is discussed. This is because the techniques are so broad that it's easy to find examples.
## Hardware
Through my work at De Beers, it has become obvious that [[Cross-functionality|T-Shaped]] individuals can exist in this domain. With people like [[Cross-functionality#Krystian Wytrzymaly|Krystian]] and [[Cross-functionality#Julian Salazar|Julian]], they demonstrate that so long as you have the skills, aptitude and desire to learn and get involved in whatever work is required for the team to be successful, [[Agile|Agility]] is possible in the hardware and physical production environment.
