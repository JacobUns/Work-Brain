# Problems
- Lack of collaborative design is causing miscommunication, single point dependencies and lack of accountability within the team
- Unclear Roles & Responsibilities causing conflict
- Ivory Tower vs Collaborative Design feels black and white with little grey in the middle
	- This is due to the bias generated by providing potential solutions
- Vocalising frustration in the wrong way
	- [[Quotes#^2bb652|Criticize in Private, Praise in Public]] #personalDevelopment
	- Coaching rather than Teaching #personalDevelopment 
- Damaging the psychological safety within the team due to above
- Disengaged team members during meetings
- Non-functional constraints aren't clear to the team
- No written version of the functional requirements in Theme/Epic/Feature form
- Not release planning in detail based on written functional & non-functional requirements
- Time constraints being placed on team due to Laura's requesting dates ASAP
- Communication barriers between Three Amigos causing friction
- Not directly answering questions
	- Example - Laura asking whether we were aware of the Stage Gate process being implemented by Martyn, with Michele answering about the rollout of the Agent onto machines.
# Ideal Solution
- Design and Ideate as a team on potential solutions
	- Parallels here for [[Kotter's Model - 8 Steps to Change|Kotter's]]
- Do not put a solution in front of the team as part of this as it biases the conversation
- Use visualisation techniques rather than written word to generate the ideas
	- Sequence Diagrams, Process Flows, Architectural diagrams etc.
