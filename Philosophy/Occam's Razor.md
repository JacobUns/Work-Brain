Of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred
# Origin
Posited by philosopher William Ockham, who lived between 1285 and 1347/49, he stated "pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate", which directly translates to "Plurality should not be posited without necessity". It has parallels with principles invoked by other major names in history such as Galileo who also defended that the simplest [[Learning Test Cycles#Hypotheses|Hypothesis]] is often to be preferred.
