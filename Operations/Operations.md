# About
Operations is the general domain for all activities towards growing a business in value and making money. It will include the production process, as well as finance and resourcing. The primary goal of this domain is to increase profit, which can be done in many ways such as reduction of waste, through concepts like [[Lean]], retention of customers through such operations as [[Customer Support]], increase of sales through [[Commercial]] or [[Marketing]] efforts, or improvement in productivity through [[Project Management]] or [[Line Management]].

Because a business's ability to make money are the people employed by the business, operations also covers this domain and all of the surrounding responsibilities. As with all domains of business, we benefit from being able to measure our impact with initiatives we implement in fields such as Learning & Development. Through the use of [[operational metrics]], we can inspect the effect our actions within [[Leadership]] groups have on the people we lead.

# Business Ownership
Management of business is a core part of the operations domain. Having the resources required to grow the business is essential, and having the right ownership strategy impacts the liquidity of a business and its ability to expand as required.

There are different types of ownership structure, which include:
- Sole Proprietorship
- Partnership
- [[Private Companies]]
- [[Public Limited Company]]
- Not-for-profit organisations
- Cooperatives
