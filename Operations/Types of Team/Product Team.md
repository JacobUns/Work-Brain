# Description
A Product team is a team that is involved heavily in the discovery of the product as well as the delivery of the product. This is typically done through story mapping exercises with the stakeholders and/or product team member (Owner or Manager).

# Example
Traditional Scrum Teams are a Product team. Close interface with the customer from the beginning of a project, decomposing the work with the product owner and customer in certain cases, and then owning delivery of it, working closely with the customer to feedback and review what's been delivered.
