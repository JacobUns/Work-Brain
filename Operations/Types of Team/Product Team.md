# Description
A Product team is a team that is involved heavily in the [[discovery]] of the product as well as the delivery of the product. This is typically done through [[story mapping]] exercises with the stakeholders and/or product team member ([[Scrum#Product Owner|Owner]] or [[Product Management|Manager]]).

# Example
[[Scrum]] seems to describe the [[Scrum#Roles|Scrum Team]] as a Product team. Close interface with the customer from the beginning of a project, decomposing the work with the product owner and customer in certain cases, and then owning delivery of it, working closely with the customer to feedback and review what's been delivered.
