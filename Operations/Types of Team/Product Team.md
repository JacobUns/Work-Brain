# Description
A Product team is a stable group of individuals that are dedicated to the development of a [[Product]]. They are usually involved heavily in the [[discovery]] as well as the delivery, identifying and defining their [[Learning Test Cycles#Assumptions|Assumptions]], generating [[Learning Test Cycles#Hypotheses|Hypotheses]], running [[Learning Test Cycles#Experiments|Experiments]] and [[Learning Test Cycles#Measurement|Measuring]] their results.

Product teams employ a variety of techniques to identify the work they will execute against, including [[story mapping]] exercises with the stakeholders and/or their product team member, usually either a [[Product Management|Product Manager]] or [[Scrum#Product Owner|Product Owner]].

## Members
The product team will include a [[Product Management|Product Manager]] or [[Scrum#Product Owner|Product Owner]], a [[Delivery Management|Delivery Manager]] or [[Scrum#Scrum Master|Scrum Master]], and a [[Scrum#Development Team|Development Team]] of [[Software Engineering|Software Engineers]], [[Mechanical Engineering|Mechanical Engineers]] or [[Electronic Engineering|Electronic Engineers]], and [[Quality Assurance|QAs]] to validate the result.

In some cases, there may be a [[Product Management|Product Manager]] and a [[Scrum#Product Owner|Product Owner]], as well as a Business Analyst, dedicated to communicating with a customer or executing research of a market sector. This is fairly heavy, and has a fair amount of waste associated as a result due to the amount of repeat communications that are likely to be needed to ensure all of the [[Product]] team members understand the customer need.

# Example
[[Scrum]] seems to describe the [[Scrum#Roles|Scrum Team]] as a product team. Close interface with the customer from the beginning of a project, decomposing the work with the [[Scrum#Product Owner|Product Owner]] and customer in certain cases, and then owning delivery of it, working closely with the customer to feedback and review what's been delivered.
