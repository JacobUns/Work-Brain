# Description
In 1962, a book was published written by Everett Rogers called the "Diffusion of innovations". Rogers proposes that five main elements influence the spread of a new idea:
- The innovation itself
- Adopters
- Communication Channels
- Time
- Social Systems

The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain. Within the rate of adoption, there is a point at which an innovation reaches critical mass. In 1989, management consultants working at Regis Mckenna theorised that this point lies at the boundary between the early adopters and the early majority. The gap between niche appeal and mass (self-sustaining) adoption was originally labeled "the marketing chasm".

The categories of adopters are innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards.
