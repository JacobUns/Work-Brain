# About
There are many ways to build strong teams, but the most successful teams are those with enough shared experience and psychological safety that they can tackle anything together.

When new teams come together, they'll often need some mechanism to start the conversation, for example the [[Onboarding High Five Me|High Five]] or [[Two Truths and a Lie]] activities. Through working together over time, the team will go through [[Tuckman's Model|Tuckman's]] transitionary stages. During the [[Tuckman's Model#Storming |Storming]] phase a team will need to recover. This is where [[Team Bonding Activities]] can help the team create enough shared experience and to understand what makes each other tick. The root of this though is vulnerability and psychological safety.
