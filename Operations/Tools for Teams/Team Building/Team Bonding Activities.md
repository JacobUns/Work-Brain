# About
Team Bonding activities are a way of creating shared experiences between members of a team. Forming lasting relationships, [[Psychological Safety]] and the desired [[Culture]] within a team is challenging, and the key to this is shared experience.

[[Team Building]] has an unconscious bias in people where they hear the term and they think of cheesy games they're not going to enjoy run by people that have no understanding of the dynamics at play in the team.
# Ideas
- Go Karting
- Day at a Theme Park
	- Generally fun, but it also creates some vulnerability and through that forming of bonds
- Escape Rooms
	- Good combination of problem-solving and fun 
- Team Meals
	- Should not be "Work". These are the opportunities to learn about each other more and connect as people.
- Top Golf
	- Great for teams who have people that don't golf to make themselves feel silly
- Stand-up Comedy
- Go Ape
	- As with theme park, if there are people that may get scared or feel silly it creates some vulnerability
- Crystal Maze Experience
- Laser Clay Pigeon Shooting
- Archery
- Liquid Leisure
- Paintball
- Airsoft
- Kayaking
