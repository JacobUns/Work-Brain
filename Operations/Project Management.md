# About
Project Management covers a lot of the traditional roles associated with [[Delivery]] of projects to customers, but differs from the [[Delivery Management|Delivery Manager]] role in approach. Traditionally, when someone refers to Project Management it brings with it connotations of [[Waterfall]] methodologies and practices associated. There are many tools associated that are widely valuable, however, such as [[Risks, Actions, Issues and Dependencies|RAID]] logs, [[RACI]] matrixes, and [[Delivery Reporting|Reporting Practices]] amongst others.

Typically, the image that everyone has in their heads when you mention Project Management and Managers involves some form of holding people to account (which is usually viewed negatively by those that are regularly chased), creating some [[Gantt Chart|Gantt Charts]], and reporting on the progress towards key milestones. It uses a more [[Leadership#Command & Control|Command & Control]] than [[Servant-Leadership|Servant-Leader]] communication style, which can cause [[Software Engineering|Software Engineers]] to feel micromanaged and dictated to, which ultimately damages [[Psychological Safety]] within the team.
