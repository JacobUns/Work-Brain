# Outcomes
A desired state given a set of [[#outputs]]. The benefit created given [[#outputs]] are generated and meet the needs of the people that receive it. This might be the creation of a behaviour that drives a desired output. Outcomes are often accompanied by experimentation to adapt the output results.
## Example
In a [[service]] led [[product]], this may be to provide an experience that delights the customer and makes their lives easier

In [[operations]], this may be to create a transparency and [[culture]] that meets the desired values
# Outputs
Evidence that indicates an outcome is worth pursuing. Provides information to make decisions. Is created by the work done by people involved in achieving the outcome.
## Example
[[Revenue]], project or team artefacts, products, new processes, customer satisfaction, [[Net Promoter Score]]
# Outcomes over Outputs
[[Resources#^OutcomesOverOutputs|Outcomes over Outputs]], a written by #JoshSeiden, is a [[leadership]] book that explains the difference between the two concepts and when it's appropriate to focus on one over the other.

Other publications, such as [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/11/its-not-just-semantics-managing-outcomes), have also discussed the topic and indicate that [[#outcomes]] are often more valuable to focus on than outputs. This is due to the desire to achieve a long-lasting effect, rather than a short-term one. An example of this is in a business focusing on generating [[revenue]] over providing a rewarding experience. Though there may be a short-term spike in [[revenue]], the moment the focus changes to something else then the artificial increase returns to its baseline.

If the focus was on an [[#Outcomes|outcome]], such as to create a [[product]] that fulfils an unmet need for the user or purchaser, that links to an output of [[revenue]], then, should this [[#Outcomes|outcome]] be met, the spike in [[revenue]] becomes a more gradual increase, but it also becomes organic and part of the baseline. Changes to a business's approach can then be tested through [[lean]] concepts, such as [[Learning Test Cycles]], that will have a measurable and observable impact on the desired [[#Outcomes|outcome]].
