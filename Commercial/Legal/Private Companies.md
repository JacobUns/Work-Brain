# About
A private company may not offer its shares to the general public. It can be limited by shares, where the members' liability is limited to the amount unpaid on shares they hold, or limited by guarantee, where the members' liability is limited to the amount they have agreed to contribute to the company's assets become insolvent.

## Limited
Similar to [[PLC - Public Limited Company|Public Limited Companies]], Private companies can also be limited but have different restrictions from [[PLC - Public Limited Company|PLCs]].
## Unlimited
Private companies may also be unlimited, which means there is no limit to the members' liability. If the business becomes insolvent there is no cap on the amount that shareholders must pay.

The company can operate with or without share capital. In instances with share capital, share allocation defines each shareholder's rights within the company, but does not set a fixed limit on what each shareholder is liable for. Theoretically, this may indicate the liability share split between investors, but should one not be able to pay their debt it would fall to the other shareholders.
