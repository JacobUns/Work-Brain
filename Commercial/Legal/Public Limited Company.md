# About
A PLC is a company which can offer its shares to the public and which has an allotted share capital with a nominal value of at least Â£50,000. The shares of a PLC may be traded on an exchange, but it is not a requirement.

A PLC differs from a [[Private Companies|Private Company]], as private companies may not offer their shares to the public.
