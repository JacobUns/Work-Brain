# About
A Managed Service Provider Model looks to provide the same value that a customer could develop themselves if they had the skills and expertise without needing to recruit and carry the employer [[risk]] associated with new headcount. Instead of building inhouse, the solution is outsourced and so the managed service provider carries all the technical [[risk]], while the customer carries business [[risk]]. The customer pays the provider directly for their service, rather than going through a [[Distributor]] or [[Agency]].

There are many types of Managed Service Providers; these include but are not limited to [[Software as a Service |SaaS]], [[Infrastructure as a Service|IaaS]], [[Platform as a Service|PaaS]] and other [[Cloud Computing]] models where the infrastructure or network responsibility is delegated to a third-party.

Over recent years these models have become more popular, as the burden of responsibility for managing your own infrastructure and vendor products is diminished. Historically, larger companies would buy their technologies from a [[distributor]] or [[agency]] at a discounted rate, and would then host those products on their own infrastructure, commonly in a data-centre where they own the racks that host the software.

Companies are more regularly seeing that the overhead of support and maintenance on these third-party technologies results in less time to deliver against their own product or service. By letting a third-party own the responsibility of keeping their system up-to-date, avoid security problems, introduce new features, all of which allow a company can then reap the benefits without the technical debt overhead.

On top of the technical debt benefit, few customers of a service are likely to be as proficient with a technology as the people that created it. Support and assistance when required therefore become significantly increased, as less learning is required to understand an issue.

The challenge for a Managed Service Provider is striking the right balance between offering an affordable service that entices new users, and making a profit. Most providers do this through tiered subscription to their service, providing more functionality or resource at a higher cost.
