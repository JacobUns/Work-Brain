# About
Objective Key Results, also known as OKRs, are a method of conveying a business or departments strategic direction to a wide group of people. It's often used as a mechanism to link up various goals across separate departments to a wider business objective. 

OKRs are often fairly broad in their scope, but give a level of aspiration for which to aim. As a result, it can be fairly difficult for people further down the structure of an organisation to understand how they are contributing to the business's objectives in their day-to-day work. To aid this, businesses often look to pair OKRs with [[Key Performance Indicators|KPIs]]. In a similar vein to [[Product Metrics#North Star|North Star]] metrics in the [[Product Manager|Product]] space, the OKR acts as the guiding light for the department while the [[Key Performance Indicators|KPIs]] show the steps being taken to try and achieve it.
